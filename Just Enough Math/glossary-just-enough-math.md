| Base               | The number an exponent is applied to.                                                                                  |      |
| Binary Search      | An algorithm that finds items in sorted lists by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.                         |      |
| Coefficient        | Any number that appears in a polynomial, either multiplied with a variable or on its own.                              |      |
| Combination        | An arrangement of items in which the order of the items does not matter.                                               |      |
| Degree             | The size of the exponent operating on a term. In a polynomial, degree refers to the largest exponent of all the terms. |      |
| Exponent           | A number written over another one indicating how many times the second number is multiplied by itself.                 |      |
| Exponential Growth | Growth pattern where the output doubles or increases by a constant factor for each unit increase in input.             |      |
| Expression         | A sequence of numbers, symbols, variables, and operations that can be evaluated to get a single result.                |      |
| Factorial          | The product of all positive integers less than or equal to n, denoted as n!.                                           |      |
| Function           | A mathematical relationship that maps each input to exactly one output.                                                |      |
| Growth Rate        | How quickly a function’s output increases as its input increases.                                                      |      |
| Linear Growth      | Growth pattern where quantities increase by a constant amount in each time period.                                     |      |
| Logarithm          | The inverse operation of exponentiation; log_b(x) asks “to what power must b be raised to get x?”                      |      |
| Logarithmic Growth | Growth pattern that increases slowly, characteristic of efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms.                       |      |
| Permutation        | An arrangement of objects where order matters.                                                                         |      |
| Polynomial         | A mathematical expression consisting of variables, coefficients, and non-negative integer exponents.                   |      |
| Polynomial Growth  | Growth pattern described by polynomial functions (linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.).                                     |      |
| Quadratic Growth   | Growth pattern where quantities increase proportionally to the square of the input size.                               |      |
| Term               | A combination of coefficients and variables, or a number on its own.                                                   |      |
| Variable           | A letter or symbol that represents a numeric value that can change.                                                    |      |
