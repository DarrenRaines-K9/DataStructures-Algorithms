| BigO            | 1      | Know what constants are and why we can drop them from Big O notation                                                     | Remember, Understand |
| BigO            | 1      | Analyze simple code snippets and determine their time and space complexity using Big O                                   | Apply                |
| BigO            | 1      | Order common complexities from best to worst O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(nÂ²)                                 | Remember, Understand |
| BigO            | 1      | Choose or write more efficient code based on Big O trade-offs                                                            | Apply                |
| BigO            | 1      | Explain the time complexity of common operations (insert, lookup, delete) on Arrays, Lists Maps, Stacks, Queues and Sets | Apply                |
| Problem Solving | 1      | Recall the 5 steps of the Algorithm solving guide: Clarify > Plan > Implement > Test > Optimize                          | Remember, Understand |
